    "> Machine learning is the subfiel of computer science that gives \"computers the ability to lean without being explicitly programmed\"\n",
    "\n",
    "With \"without being explicitly programmed\"\n",
    "\n",
    "example: interpretation of data -> extract relevant data (feature extration) -> set of rules to classify.\n",
    "Rules are hard to formulate generically. Instead, machine learning can be used to build a model which interprets all features and matches that to a known output. That way it learns the set of rules instead of being explicitly programmed.\n",

    "**Popular techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Regression/Estimation: used for predicting a continuous value. For example, predicting things like the price of a house based on its characteristics, or to estimate the Co2 emission from a carâ€™s engine. \n",
    "* A Classification technique is used for Predicting the class or category of a case, for example, if a cell is benign or malignant, or whether or not a customer will churn. \n",
    "* Clustering groups of similar cases, for example, can find similar patients, or can be used for customer segmentation in the banking field. \n",
    "* Association technique is used for finding items or events that often co-occur, for example, grocery items that are usually bought together by a particular customer. \n",
    "* Anomaly detection is used to discover abnormal and unusual cases, for example, it is used for credit card fraud detection.\n",
    "* Sequence mining is used for predicting the next event, for instance, the click-stream in websites.\n",
    "* Dimension reduction is used to reduce the size of data.\n",
    "* Recommendation systems, this associates people's preferences with others who have similar tastes, and recommends new items to them, such as books or movies.\n",
